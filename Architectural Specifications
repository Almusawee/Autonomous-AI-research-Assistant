# Architectural Specification: Autonomous Research AI

## Overview

The **Autonomous Research AI** is a novel architecture that implements motivational drive systems to enable genuine scientific hypothesis generation. Unlike traditional language models that operate reactively, this system features intrinsic motivation, ethical constraints, and knowledge space exploration.

## Core Innovation

### Drive-Based Motivation System

The architecture transforms psychological drives into mathematical operations in embedding space:

```python
# Mathematical Foundation
D_d = normalize(Σ[E(w_p)] - Σ[E(w_n)])  # Drive direction vector
D_final = α·(D_d + β·S) + (1-α)·(D_d + β·C)  # Science/Creative blending
logits_biased = logits_base + γ·(E_tokens · D_final)  # Steering
```

## Core Components

### 1. DriveSystem

```python
@dataclass
class DriveState:
    need: float           # 0.0-1.0 current need level
    satisfaction: float   # 0.0-1.0 current satisfaction  
    weight: float         # Drive importance (0.1-2.5)
    decay_rate: float     # Need regeneration rate (0.001-0.2)
    
    def pressure(self) -> float:
        return self.weight * max(0.0, self.need - self.satisfaction)
```

**Drive Dynamics:**
- Pressure = Weight × Unsatisfied Need  
- Synergistic/Antagonistic interactions between drives  
- Dynamic satisfaction based on output quality

- Science concepts: `["energy","particle","quantum","field","force"]`  
- Creative concepts: `["story","imagine","future","myth","symbol"]`  
- Drive-specific positive/negative concept mappings  

---

### 3. InternalSimulator
- Steers generation using drive direction vectors  
- Scores candidates across multiple dimensions  
- Maintains exploration history for novelty tracking

```python
class ExploreKnowledgeSpace:
    research_frontiers = {
        'physics': ['quantum error correction', 'room temperature superconductivity'],
        'biology': ['protein folding prediction', 'cellular aging reversal'],
        'chemistry': ['catalyst design', 'battery materials'],
        'tech': ['quantum algorithms', 'neuromorphic computing'],
        'health': ['personalized medicine', 'drug resistance mechanisms']
    }
```

- Ethical constraints with prohibited/dual-use domain detection  
- Prompt injection detection with regex patterns  
- Medical disclaimer requirements  
- Drive parameter bounds and balance monitoring

## Mathematical Framework

### Drive Projection Equations

1. **Concept Embedding**
```
E(w) = model.transformer.wte(tokenize(w)).mean(dim=0)
```

2. **Drive Direction**
```
D_d = normalize(mean(E(pos_concepts)) - mean(E(neg_concepts)))
```

3. **Science-Creative Blending**
```
S = normalize(mean(E(science_concepts)))
C = normalize(mean(E(creative_concepts)))  
D_final = α·(D_d + β·S) + (1-α)·(D_d + β·C)
```

4. **Generation Steering**
```
similarity = (E_tokens · D_final) / (||E_tokens|| · ||D_final||)
logits_biased = logits_base + γ·similarity
```

## Evaluation Metrics

**Multi-dimensional Scoring:**
- Information Density: Unique tokens ratio

By implementing psychological principles as mathematical operations in embedding space, we create AI systems that don't just process information but actively pursue scientific understanding within robust ethical constraints.

The system demonstrates that **AI safety and alignment can be achieved through architectural design** rather than external constraints, creating inherently motivated systems that want to discover truth while respecting ethical boundaries.
