# Autonomous Research AI - Conceptual Architecture

## Overview
This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a novel AI architecture for autonomous scientific hypothesis generation, developed through human-AI collaborative design.

## Important Context
- **Primary Contribution**: Conceptual architecture and systems design
- **Development Method**: AI-assisted implementation of human architectural vision  
- **Current Implementation**: Proof-of-concept using GPT-2
- **Core Innovation**: Drive-based motivational system for autonomous research

## Key Components
- **Motivational Drive System** (Curiosity, Coherence, Novelty, Truthfulness)
- **Embedding Space Steering** for hypothesis generation
- **Built-in Ethical Constraints** and safety monitoring
- **Autonomous Research Behavior** simulation

## Architectural Innovation

This implementation demonstrates a novel drive-based architecture for autonomous AI research, featuring:

- **Motivational Drive System**: Curiosity, coherence, novelty, truthfulness
- **Embedding Space Steering**: Mathematical projection of drives into semantic space  
- **Knowledge Exploration**: Advanced hypothesis generation through concept pairing
- **Integrated Safety**: Multi-layered ethical constraints and monitoring
- **Evidence Integration**: Wikipedia-based verification system

## Core Innovation

The system transforms psychological drives into geometric operations in language model embedding space, creating genuine goal-directed research behavior rather than simple pattern completion.
